      <h2>Rules for the input file format:</h2>
      <p>
        0. This program takes 2 lines of text from the input file consecutively
        per each round of testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. In your first line, provide regular expression after number of the
        test case in 2 digits followed by a dot and an empty space. (ex. 01. (a|b)*|c)
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In the next line, provide a string that you would like to compare
        with your regular expression without any symbol or space before and
        after.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Make sure that your Regular Expression fulfills the following requirements:
        <ul>
          <li>It should not be an empty string (blank line)
          </li>
          <li>
            If a parenthesis is used, it should always be in pair with another.
          </li>
          <li>
            The string only consists of valid symbols: alphabets, numbers, operators (dot, |, parenthesis, *, ?, +)
          </li>
          <li>
            No Kleene closure symbol is are used more than once consecutively. (ex. "a**", "b?*")
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        4. The program has additional features in order to reduce ambiguity, and to enhance the performance.
        <br>You find warning messages in the console when such case is detected.
        <ul>
          <li>
            In case of a regular expression already containing concatenation symbol (.), the program will still run, but after removing all such symbols.            
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of a regular expression containing any alphabets in upper cases, the program will still run, but after converting all to lower cases first.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the string for comparison (in the second line) is in upper-case, this will as well be converted to lower-case, but without any warning.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        * Check the console for detailed error description in case you don't get
        results for all the provided test cases.
